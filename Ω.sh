立 refers to the hypothesised top element of the lattice of languages, ordered by power. It may refer to multiple languages, as the power may be a partial order, rather than a total order. There are two currently recognised paths there, one of which is known as 'the Road to Lisp'; another currently ends with Haskell.

The path to 立 used to be threefold; the MLish path (now Haskell), the Lisp path (now Arc), the Smalltalk path.

I claim that the Smalltalk path now is taken by Ioke.
